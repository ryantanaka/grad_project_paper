\title{WRENCH Pedagogic Modules: Distributed Computing Courseware}
\author{Ryan Tanaka}

The WRENCH Pedagogic Modules are a guided set of hands on, educational
activities aimed at teaching distributed computing concepts using the
WRENCH workflow management system simulation framework. This simulation
based, distributed computing courseware was developed with the intention
of accelerating distributed computing education in the classroom by affording
higher student participation over traditional methods and by providing a
more effective means of pedagogy.
